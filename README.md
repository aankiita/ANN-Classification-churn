# ANN-Classification-churn

This project is a Machine Learning web application built using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Streamlit to predict whether a bank customer is likely to exit (churn) or not.
The model takes customer details such as credit score, age, balance, geography, and salary as input and provides a churn prediction probability.
